◇ Overview ◇
	
	
	This is the tool to support your run on Super Mario Maker 2 Story Mode speedrun.
	Get the number of coins from screen and display the difference.
	There is also a function to display the operation procedure for castle construction and course selection.


◇ Environment ◇
	
	This only works on 1920x1080 resolution video devices.

	I only able to confirm the operation under the following conditions.
	・Using the "AvarMedia GC550" on Windows10 PC.
	・Using the "Open Broadcast Software" with "OBS-VirtualCam" plugin on Windows10 PC.
	In other environment, I have not confirmed behavior.

	※When you access at the same time from some programs for a video capture device, is causes some errors.
	　In this case, I recommend to use abstract capture device like a OBS-VirtualCam.
