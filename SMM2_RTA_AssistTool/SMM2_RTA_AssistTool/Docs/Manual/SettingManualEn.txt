【Death Detection Algorithm】
If there is a moment that meets all of the following three conditions, it is determined to have died.

(1) All pixel values are less than [PixelValueThreshold].
(2) From [PastTimeRange] seconds before until the present moment, the amplitude of the sound is always [AmplitudeThreshold] or less.
(3) However, do not detects death [DeathSpan] seconds from the time last died.

Items inside of [] are in the Setting->Parameters in main menu bar at the top of this software.
In default, items are set to following values.

PixelValueThreshold = 0
PastTimeRange = 1
AmplitudeThreshold = 0
DeathSpan = 3
